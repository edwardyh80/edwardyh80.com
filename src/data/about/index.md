Hi! I am Edward from Hong Kong, who enjoys learning new things and building random stuff (useful or useless) for fun.

Shortly after graduating from [CUHK](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), I joined [Rakuten Travel](https://travel.rakuten.co.jp/) as a NoSQL database engineer. In my daily work, I take part in the design and maintenance of NoSQL databases so that data stored is safe, available and free from corruption. While I am still relatively new to database management, it has been great fun working with knowledgeable peers on a wide range of meaningful projects, from data migration to performance tuning. Keep on reading to explore more!
